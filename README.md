# sudoku
A Sudoku helper based on jquery and knockoutjs.

Most of this code was written quite a few years ago now. 

The tool allows the user to create a puzzle by clicking the cells or by uploading a puzzle using the Load Puzzle control. 

Once set-up, the user can make hypotheses of what value a cell must hold and undo these hypotheses when a contradiction is reached - such as a cell having no possible candidates available.
